## small write up

1. What you technologies you used and why

I stuck to the original codebase with a few tweaks:

-   I updated Bootstrap to 5.1.
-   In `webpack.config.js`, I added `devServer: {host: "0.0.0.0"}` which enabled me to check the dev site on my mobile device.

Why? Well, if it ain't broke etc. Plus, it seemed like you wanted Bootstrap and I was interested to learn it.

2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose

I've checked out a lot of tech, but I'd never used Bootstrap before. It was actually more straightforward than I expected.

I'd really like to convert this to a React project. My code is a mega html file that is screaming to be broken into components. But it's time to put the pencils down, ah well.

3. What you enjoyed the most and why

Picking up some Bootstrap ... I'm always happy to learn something new.

## Thanks again!
